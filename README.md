# Multiomics-Protein-Prediction

## Summary
This repository provides code for a deep learning framework that integrates multi-omics data to predict protein abundance. The models incorporate RNA expression, DNA methylation, or both as inputs, and their predictive features are analyzed using interpretation methods. By combining omics layers, the approach improves prediction accuracy and highlights regulatory mechanisms relevant to cancer biology.

Note: This repository contains the code accompanying a manuscript currently in preparation for journal submission. The content may be updated as the manuscript progresses toward publication.

Citation: Citation details will be provided once the article is accepted and published.
